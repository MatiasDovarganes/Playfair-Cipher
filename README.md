# Playfair-Cipher
A Playfair Cipher code that encodes messages by transforming pairs of letters using a 5x5 grid (or diagram) of letters generated from a secret key. In this cipher, the key is used to construct a unique matrix—omitting 'j' by replacing it with 'i'—which is then filled with the remaining letters of the alphabet. The plaintext message is first processed by removing spaces, converting any 'j's to 'i's, and splitting it into pairs of letters, with special rules to handle duplicate letters or odd-length messages by inserting an extra letter (usually 'x' or 'i'). Depending on the positions of each letter pair in the grid, different substitution rules are applied: if the pair lies in the same row, each letter is replaced by the letter immediately to its right (wrapping around as needed); if they share a column, each is replaced by the letter immediately below; and if they form a rectangle, each letter is replaced by the letter in the same row but in the column of the other letter. This method of encrypting digraphs rather than single letters enhances security by reducing the effectiveness of simple frequency analysis.
